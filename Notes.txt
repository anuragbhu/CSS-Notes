CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document. CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed.
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.
A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.
	html {
		background-color: red;
		font-size: 12px;
	}
Note: Do not add a space between the property value and the unit:
	Incorrect (space): margin-left: 20 px;
	Correct (nospace): margin-left: 20px;

CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:
	Inline CSS - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
	Internal CSS - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
	External CSS - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file
	
CSS Selectors:
	CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.
	We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:
		Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
		Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
		Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
		Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
		Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
		
	Selector: #id, Example: #firstname, Example description: Selects the element with id="firstname"
	Selector: .class, Example: .intro, Example description: Selects all elements with class="intro"
	Selector: element.class, Example: p.intro, Example description: Selects only <p> elements with class="intro"
	Selector: *, Example: *, Example description: Selects all elements
	Selector: element, Example: p, Example description: Selects all <p> elements
	Selector: element,element,.., Example: div, p, Example description: Selects all <div> elements and all <p> elements

CSS Properties:
	
	Property: Value;
	color:
	background-color:
	height:
	width:
	border:
	visibility:
	text-align:
	float:left/right
	
Cascading Order:
	What style will be used when there is more than one style specified for an HTML element?
	All the styles in a page will "cascade" into a new "virtual" style sheet by the following rules, where number one has the highest priority:
		Inline style (inside an HTML element)
		External and internal style sheets (in the head section)
		Browser default
	So, an inline style has the highest priority, and will override external and internal styles and browser defaults.
	
CSS Box Model:

CSS Comments:
	A CSS comment is placed inside the <style> element, and starts with /* and ends with */
	
Website Layout:
	A website is often divided into headers, navigation menus, content and a footer.
