CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document. CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed.
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.
A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.
	html {
		background-color: red;
		font-size: 12px;
	}
Note: Do not add a space between the property value and the unit:
	Incorrect (space): margin-left: 20 px;
	Correct (nospace): margin-left: 20px;
	
Tip: The word cascading means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the parent. 
	 So, if you set the color of the body text to "blue", all headings, paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will also get 
	 the same color (unless you specify something else)!

CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:
	Inline CSS - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
	Internal CSS - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
	External CSS - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file
	
CSS Selectors:
	CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.
	We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:
		Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
		Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
		Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
		Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
		Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
		
	Selector: #id, Example: #firstname, Example description: Selects the element with id="firstname"
	Selector: .class, Example: .intro, Example description: Selects all elements with class="intro"
	Selector: element.class, Example: p.intro, Example description: Selects only <p> elements with class="intro"
	Selector: *, Example: *, Example description: Selects all elements
	Selector: element, Example: p, Example description: Selects all <p> elements
	Selector: element,element,.., Example: div, p, Example description: Selects all <div> elements and all <p> elements

CSS Properties:
	
	Property: Value;
	color:
	background-color:
	height:
	width:
	border: 2px solid powderblue;
	visibility: hidden; --- element will be hidden from the webpage but still takes up space ---
	display: none; --- the element will be hidden ---
	float:left/right;
	font-family: courier;
	font-size: 160%;
	margin: 50px;
	text-align:center;
	
	
Cascading Order:
	What style will be used when there is more than one style specified for an HTML element?
	All the styles in a page will "cascade" into a new "virtual" style sheet by the following rules, where number one has the highest priority:
		Inline style (inside an HTML element)
		External and internal style sheets (in the head section)
		Browser default
	So, an inline style has the highest priority, and will override external and internal styles and browser defaults.
	
CSS Box Model:
	
	
	
CSS Comments:
	A CSS comment is placed inside the <style> element, and starts with /* and ends with */
	
Website Layout:
	A website is often divided into headers, navigation menus, content, aside (Sidebar content of the page) and a footer.
	
What are Pseudo-classes? (False Classes)
	A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.
	For example, it can be used to:
		Style an element when a user mouses over it
		Style visited and unvisited links differently
		
		div:hover {
		  background-color: blue;
		}
		
What are Pseudo-Elements? (False Elements)
	A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element.
	For example, it can be used to:
		Style the first letter, or line, of an element
		Insert content before, or after, the content of an element
		
		p::first-line {
		  color: #ff0000;
		  font-variant: small-caps;
		}
		
Notice: 
	The double colon notation - ::first-line versus :first-line
	The double colon replaced the single-colon notation for pseudo-elements in CSS3. 
	This was an attempt from W3C to distinguish between pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements.
	
CSS Attribute Selectors:
	It is possible to style HTML elements that have specific attributes or attribute values.
	The [attribute] selector is used to select elements with a specified attribute.
	The following example selects all <a> elements with a target attribute:
		
		a[target] {
		  background-color: yellow;
		}
		
		a[target="_blank"] {
		  background-color: yellow;
		}


CSS :nth-child() Selector:
	The :nth-child(n) selector matches every element that is the nth child of its parent.
		/* Selects the second li element in a list */
		li:nth-child(2) {
		  background: lightgreen;
		}

		/* Selects every third element among any group of siblings */
		:nth-child(3) {
		  background: yellow;
		}
		
		/* The index of the first child is 1 */
		p:nth-child(odd) {
		  background: red;
		}
		
		/* Using a formula (an + b). Description: a represents a cycle size, n is a counter (starts at 0), and b is an offset value. */
		p:nth-child(3n+0) {
		  background: red;
		}

SASS is Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets:
	Sass is a CSS pre-processor.
	Sass reduces repetition of CSS and therefore saves time.
	
	/* Define standard variables and values for website */
	$bgcolor: lightblue;
	$textcolor: darkblue;
	$fontsize: 18px;

	/* Use the variables */
	body {
	  background-color: $bgcolor;
	  color: $textcolor;
	  font-size: $fontsize;
	}
